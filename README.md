# Kaggle Projects Portfolio

This repo contains mini machine learning projects built as part of a warm-up phase for deeper DS/ML work. Each notebook explores a classic Kaggle dataset using foundational tools like Pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Projects
- `titanic.ipynb` – Binary classification using logistic regression
- `housing-price-model.ipynb` – Regression with feature engineering and pipelines
- `forest-fire-risk.ipynb` – [optional] Time series + classification

## Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Purpose
This repo demonstrates fundamental ML workflows and coding fluency, preparing for more advanced CV/AI projects like RADAR and Trash Traceback Engine.
